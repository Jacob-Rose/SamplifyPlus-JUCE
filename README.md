# SamplifyPlus-JUCE

My first attempt with using the JUCE library. Goal of project was to create a new sample browser for music producers.

Tha main mechanic that I wanted from a sample browser was a waveform view and a tagging system. The waveform view is working great, with the ability to custom draw the waveform in any way desired, but the loading of this many waveforms slows down the system greatly, especially with large sample libraries.

Old project, need to work on more
