# SamplifyPlus-JUCE

My first attempt with using the JUCE library. 

PLEASE NOTE:
I made this project after my first year at Champlain College. The architecture is not as clear as I want it to be.

Goal of project was to create a new sample browser for music producers.

Tha main mechanic that I wanted from a sample browser was a waveform view and a tagging system. The waveform view is working great, with the ability to custom draw the waveform in any way desired, but the loading of this many waveforms slows down the system greatly, especially with large sample libraries.

This project is also before I commented anything well if at all, bad habits die hard.

I needed to hard code in the sample library location and never added tha ability to change it
Old project, need to work on more
