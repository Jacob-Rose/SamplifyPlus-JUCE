                     <p><strong>9 / 9 / 2019</strong></p><p>First Dev Post</p><p><br></p><p>Hello,</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I decided today that it was becoming excessive to modify the site and not leave old information for people who are just discovering the application. I hope to post here for updates from now on.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I am also adding the FAQ section to help explain certain points I would like to emphasize what the product is. There are some things I am keeping secret until release, but I want to keep curious people assured that work is being done as much as I can.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I am currently on the second week of my semester abroad in Montreal. I love working on the app in my free time, but I have a lot less of it now with classes. I am also currently a one-man team, as I have difficulty finding people who understand the particular issues I have with the application, specifically licensing and copyright protection as well as marketing and business associates. Email me if you are interested.</p><p>&nbsp; I am currently using the JUCE library, which I found around a year ago when the first iteration of Samplify failed to have the speed necessary and the UI control that I needed for the application. This library will allow quick ports to Mac and Windows on the same code base and UI base.</p><p><br></p><p>APPLICATION UPDATE:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I have had a new idea that I am trying to implement into the application. While purposely remaining vague, the new feature conflicts with the previous core paradigm of how the software handled loading in the information and searching. This new system, if I am correct, will increase search and sorting times for the program, and also organize the source code in the process. This will also extend to giving the user control over more options that will help in searching through specified folders.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; This system is currently in the works but will require a fair bit of a rebase, as this was a core system being redefined, After this, a visual overhaul will be implemented, with the improvements to be made already drawn out.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I have the current goal of getting this application out for public early access by Christmas 2019, however, I am unsure if this will be the case. I also hope to have some testing copies being released in a few months. I also hope to give out free copies on release for this program to those who helped and gave feedback.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I hope to have more updates posted here soon. I also want to add a newsletter with update notes and release info, but I am unsure of the interest. I hate spam so I would make it very easy to opt-out as well as select what updates you want. Email me if you would like a newsletter and I will create one!</p><p>Thanks for the support,</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Jake Rose</p>

I made an attempt and after a week realized I made too much of a mess to clean up, so I restarted from an old build. I realized that I needed a better system for creating replacement systems, and that is to keep the working systems in until the code for the new system is fully complete, then implement. This might seem intuitive but I was previously removing code I planned on replacing, then so much was needed to be filled in, it got very confusing, especially between work sessions.</p><p>[APPLICATION UPDATE]</p><p>&nbsp; The update is still in the works but is going much better. I have made a few improvements to hopefully simplify the code base while also improving performance (hopefully). This rebase will completely reorganize the current system for handling loading in and storing sample information. This rebase comes with a new directory explorer, which will allow users to select what folders they want to load at a specific time. I plan to remain purposely vague in these features, as my development time on the app is going down and I want to keep some surprises for people. Here is the current plan for features:</p><p>1. Rebase with new Directory Explorer</p><p>2. Licensing Implementation</p><p>3. Redesign for public beta</p><p>4. THE REAL ANNOUNCEMENT</p><p><br></p><p>I have a lot of plans, but I am currently studying Game Programming in Montreal with Champlain College, as well as being the single IT student at the small international campus. I am busy, but I have a real drive with this app, and between coding for projects in Unreal and Unity, I am working on this app. I truly, from the bottom of my heart, believe this app could be very useful for ALL music producers. It is this belief that keeps me working overtime on this app.&nbsp;</p><p>If you are interested in this app, send me an email at jake@samplify.app, and let me know of anything that you could find useful. One suggestion is currently a high priority for me to implement, so I am very open.</p><p><br></p><p>Thanks for the support,</p><p>&nbsp;- Jake Rose</p>

                     <p><strong>9 / 26 / 19</strong></p><p>Hello Everyone,</p><p><br></p><p>So sadly, my time working on the app has been greatly limited by other class projects during the semester. However, I wish I could work on this app more. I want to release what I have currently, however, I need more of an infrastructure to release and give beta products.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are the things I need to implement (and their statuses) before a public release, even beta or alpha, could be done again.</p><p>1. Licensing</p><p>I recently talked to my professor at Champlain who works as a Game Programmer as his primary job, and he has a large background in networking for applications. I brought up the dilemma of how to distribute and license this out and he is going to be one of the biggest resources for getting this figured out. I need to look up asymmetrical keys and supporting individual users, but it looks like the JUCE library already has some of the overhead covered. I then need to implement a PHP section of my site to handle GET and POST request. This is probably the biggest hurdle for the future, but this is a really good start.</p><p>2. Rebase Status</p><p>This rebase is going through much better than previously attempted. Keeping the application in a compiling state between sessions helps maintain the application and allow an easier approach each time I want to work on the application. A quick reminder, time working on the app is down drastically, so sadly I have had to scope down certain aspects and reprioritize what is needed before public beta. I think I have a proper list of final things I need to implement before announcing more information and the download.</p><p>3. Website</p><p>I just made a fairly nice update to the website to hopefully explain the application better. I realized that every time I try to explain the application, I need to explain things in a specific order or the entire idea can get confusing, so I tried to readjust the format to include a summary of the goals for the application.</p><p><br></p><p>I hope that this app is a nice bridge for me as a game programmer to get involved in the music production industry to some extent, and I hope people can soon see the value of it.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Thanks for the support,</p><p>Jake Rose</p>
