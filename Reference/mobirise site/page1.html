                                   Unlike other programs, such as Splice, this program is not made to sell you samples. This program is meant to help music producers (and other professionals) look through large list and directories full of samples they have already collected, and help increase the speed (and fun) of looking for new sounds. Look through purchased sample packs, look through your own personal recorded sample library, or look through both with ease.</p>

                     <p>9 / 9 / 2019</p><p>First Dev Post</p><p><br></p><p>Hello,</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I decided today that it was becoming excessive to modify the site and not leave old information for people who are just discovering the application. I hope to post here for updates from now on.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I am also adding the FAQ section to help explain certain points I would like to emphasize what the product is. There are some things I am keeping secret until release, but I want to keep curious people assured that work is being done as much as I can.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I am currently on the second week of my semester abroad in Montreal. I love working on the app in my free time, but I have a lot less of it now with classes. I am also currently a one-man team, as I have difficulty finding people who understand the particular issues I have with the application, specifically licensing and copyright protection as well as marketing and business associates. Email me if you are interested.</p><p>&nbsp; I am currently using the JUCE library, which I found around a year ago when the first iteration of Samplify failed to have the speed necessary and the UI control that I needed for the application. This library will allow quick ports to Mac and Windows on the same code base and UI base.</p><p><br></p><p>APPLICATION UPDATE:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I have had a new idea that I am trying to implement into the application. While purposely remaining vague, the new feature conflicts with the previous core paradigm of how the software handled loading in the information and searching. This new system, if I am correct, will increase search and sorting times for the program, and also organize the source code in the process. This will also extend to giving the user control over more options that will help in searching through specified folders.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; This system is currently in the works but will require a fair bit of a rebase, as this was a core system being redefined, After this, a visual overhaul will be implemented, with the improvements to be made already drawn out.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I have the current goal of getting this application out for public early access by Christmas 2019, however, I am unsure if this will be the case. I also hope to have some testing copies being released in a few months. I also hope to give out free copies on release for this program to those who helped and gave feedback.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I hope to have more updates posted here soon. I also want to add a newsletter with update notes and release info, but I am unsure of the interest. I hate spam so I would make it very easy to opt-out as well as select what updates you want. Email me if you would like a newsletter and I will create one!</p><p>Thanks for the support,</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Jake Rose</p>
